Businesses across many industries use databases for storing all important 
information; however, to get to this data, people always need to write SQL queries 
that are consistently hard to understand, which makes it difficult for all people who 
are not tech savvy. We propose QueryMate to address this challenge. It is a 
completely universal, AI-powered conversational interface that lets any user retrieve 
data from all structured databases using natural language, voice commands, and 
multiple multilingual queries. QueryMate is carefully built for massive scalability 
and adaptability, allowing businesses in retail, healthcare, finance, and other fields 
to smoothly incorporate their own databases, in sharp difference to existing solutions 
narrowly tailored for specific stores; leveraging OpenAI Whisper, the system 
expertly converts speech to text, empowering users to interact through conversation, 
while MarianMT diligently guarantees thorough support for queries in many 
languages, completely eliminating language obstacles. A query history and a 
retrieval system powered completely by FAISS allow users to store, retrieve, and 
reuse many queries from the past, which greatly improves efficiency. The tech stack 
uses Hugging Face for natural language processing, LangChain for model 
orchestration, Streamlit for user interface, FAISS for vector-based query search, and 
Google PaLM for Structured Query Language generation. QueryMate improves 
decision-making across industries by democratizing data access as well as reducing 
total dependency on technical staff; in addition, it enables every business to 
efficiently leverage real-time data understandings.
